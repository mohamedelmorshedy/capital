        <p class="p1">A good and wise way to solve the problem of over crowdedness in Cairo and busy areas is to build
            new cities and reconstruct our desert. Thus, it was a good decision when our president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi
            has laid the first stone of the New Administrative Capital in East Cairo on July, 14. With an area of
            170,000 feddans.

        <p class="p2">The new capital city will help to strengthen and diversify the country’s economic potential by
            creating new places to live, work and visit. In order to draw people to this new capital city, a series of
            key catalyst developments will be established at its core. This will include a new government administrative
            district, a cultural district and a wide variety of urban neighbourhoods. Gradually, some of the main
            governmental offices with its employees will be transferred there by 2020. It will include 1,250 mosques and
            churches, a 5,000-seat conference center, nearly 2,000 schools and colleges, over 600 medical facilities,
            and a park that is projected to be the world’s largest one. In the end, I'd like to say that setting up this
            new capital will change the map of modern Egypt and will solve many of our problems.</p>

            road network of 650 km in length. The capital will include an international airport and an electric train to
            link it with the 10th of Ramadan and El-Salam cities. It is 60 km from Cairo and Suez city.</p>
